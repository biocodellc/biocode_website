      content : "Giving field researchers tools to validate their own data, against standards set by their own data management plan,  
      ensures that all downstream users of this data can rely on accurate data when it counts. 
      Our open source software verifies that data conforms to a known standard and checks 
      data format, numerical ranges, controlled vocabularies, and dependency checks.  Data quality tests 
      are configurable depending on your intended downstream use of the collected data."

      image: "images/team.png"
      content : "We help organizations, teams, and scientific projects to create plans for managing data, while connecting 
      to community standard vocabularies.  We enable teams to build on a global set of rules while creating an environment for individual members to interact and 
       contribute data.  Our tools are built to be adaptable to many different types of data.
       One example network is the Genomics Observatory Metadatabase, listed under projects below."
      
    - title : "Ontology alignment"
      image : "images/pipeline.png"
      content : "Ontologies help in data integration by using a logic-based framework to define relationships
      between entities.  Ontologies are a powerful tool, but often users
      are presented with the challenge of using ontologies effectively in data management.  
      We have built a flexible, scalable pipeline for integration and alignment of multiple data sources 
      using ontologies. 
      Processing is adaptable to all kinds of data or reasoning profiles, and 
      output is compatible with any type of storage technology. The ontology-data-pipeline is designed to 
      be run as a Docker container but can also be run natively in python. For more information visit the
      [ontology-data-pipeline github page](https://github.com/biocodellc/ontology-data-pipeline)."

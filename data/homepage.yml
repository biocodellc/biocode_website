    - title : "Data quality"
      image: "images/boat.jpg"
      content : "We have built an array of tests to check for data quality and completeness.  These
      tests are configurable to conform to both network and project level rules and designed to give
      instant feedback to the field researchers who are responsible for collecting the data.  For example, a network
      may require that latitutde/longitude values are collected and a project may require that these
      coordinates are constrained to a specific area of study.  Our open source software verifies a broad set of 
      tests to ensure that data that is collected conforms to a known standard.  These tests include
      data format, numerical ranges, controlled vocabularies, and dependency checks.  Data quality tests 
      are configurable depending on the intended downstream use of the collected data."

      content : "We help organizations and networks manage and improve data enabling adopters to build 
       their own network, consisting of teams and projects.  The network defines core data standards and concepts. 
       Teams build on network rules while creating an environment for individual members to interact and 
       contribute data.  Our tools are built to be adaptable to many different types of data.
       One example network is the Genomics Observatory Metadatabase, listed under projects below."
      
    - title : "Ontology alignment"
      image : "images/pipeline.png"
      content : "Ontologies help in data integration by using a logic-based framework to define relationships
      between entities.  Ontologies are a powerful tool, but often users
      are presented with the challenge of using ontologies effectively in data management.  
      We have built a flexible, scalable pipeline for integration and alignment of multiple data sources 
      using ontologies. 
      Processing is adaptable to all kinds of data or reasoning profiles, and 
      output is compatible with any type of storage technology. The ontology-data-pipeline is designed to 
      be run as a Docker container but can also be run natively in python. For more information visit the
      [ontology-data-pipeline github page](https://github.com/biocodellc/ontology-data-pipeline)."
